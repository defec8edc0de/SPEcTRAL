# SPEcTRAL - Secure Privacy prEserving TRAnsparency Logging

## Project Ideas:
- Building Blocks:
  - Transparency Logging: Service providers continuously log descriptions of the data processing on their users' data, where each description is intended for a particular user [1]
  - Secure and Privacy Preserving Log-Auditing for Accountability [2]
- Related Work: Insynd [3], PillarBox [4]
- Prefered Language: [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/en-US/)
- TODOs:
  - How to decouple both building blocks?
